ESCAPE! By Curtis, Matt and Jesse

How to play
============
First, you must register a user account (if you haven't already). Once registered, you can
login and begin a new game!

The object of Escape! is to survive the onslaught of two evil goblins until time runs out!
Each time you touch a goblin, they steal some of your life. If your life reaches zero, you die.

Dropping spikes will not kill a goblin, but slow them. This can happen twice to a single goblin, so they will be 1/4 as slow as normal. 

Treasure will randomly drop throughout gameplay, though a key may not always drop, if you're lucky enough they will!




Removing Users

To remove a user, login as admin and go to the Users menu. Once there, hit select a user and press delete to remove them from the users list.
